## Arithmetic Operators

Think back to order of operations and PEMDAS.

| Symbol | Arithmetic Operator | Example |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------- |
| +      | Addition            | x + 7   |
| -      | Subtraction         | x - 4   |
| \*     | Multiplication      | 3 \* 5  |
| /      | Division            | 5 / y   |
| %      | Modulus             | r % 2   |

## Logical Operators

| Symbol | Logical Operator         | Example |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------- |
| <      | Less than                | x < 7   |
| >      | greater than             | x > 4   |
| <=     | less than or equal to    | 3 <= 5  |
| >=     | greater than or equal to | 5 >= y  |
| ==     | equality                 | r == 2  |
| !=     | not equal                | r != 2  |

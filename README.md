## About Me

## Meeting Time

Recitations will be held in room `EB 2.04.22`. You don't have to attend the sessions you are in, given there is room in the other session. **Attendance will be taken.**

- Session A: Monday 10:00-10:50 AM
- Session B: Tuesday 10:00-10:50 AM

## Recitation Structure

Each recitation will consist of examples, exercises, and Q&A sessions. The agenda, examples, and notes will be interactively created during recitation. All students are highly encouraged to follow along.

### GitHub

I will be utilizing GitHub to share recitation files, and keep track of progress.
The main repository will be at https://github.com/dvd9604/EE3223R. This repository will contain a directory for each recitation that is conducted like so `recitation<recitation_number>`.

Each `recitation#` directory will contain the following structure.

- agenda.md
- examples/
- notes

Clone and Open VS Code in `EE3223R` directory

```shell
# make a clone of the repo
git clone https://github.com/dvd9604/EE3223R.git
# change directory into repo
cd EE3223R
# open vs code in current repo
code .
```

At the end of every Session B I will upload the complete code to GitHub.

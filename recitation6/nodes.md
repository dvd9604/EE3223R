# Recitation 6 Notes

Modified from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-classes-and-objects/

## Reasons for Classes

- code modularity
- abstraction
- can create your own abstract data type

## Classes tell us two things

- What something is
  - data members
- What something can do
  - methods

## Class components

- constructor - class member that creates the object of that class
- deconstructor - class member that deallocates memory and handles destuction of object
- object - is an instance of a class
- method - a function associated with a class
- accessor - method that allows access to object data members
- mutators - method that modify object data members

## Access Modifiers

- public - class members are directly acccessible
- private - class members are not directly accesible
- protected - class members can be accessed by sub classes
